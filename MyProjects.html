    <h2><a href="/CarrotCatcher">Carrot Catcher</a></h2>
    <p>Tiny little video game made by my freind Emerson, with myself and a few other freinds as beta testers and general helpers. Not really the best game, but it really is quite fun.</p>
    <h2><a href="/VampireQuest">Vampire Quest</a></h2>
    <p>Tiny little video game made for a project, it's really just a conversion of CCRB below, but I think it's still quite fun.</p>
    <h2><a href="/CCRB">Carrot Catcher Ruby</a></h2>
    <p>My version of the above game, re-written in ruby and re-worked because I wanted to and had time.</p>
    <h2><a href="/LGBTRights">LGBT Rights world wide</a></h2>
    <p>Honestly mostly about gay people, but for the presentation version I added some stuff about being trans on the side. May get around to adding those tidbits if I ever get around to it.</p>
