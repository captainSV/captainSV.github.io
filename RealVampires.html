      <h1>Vampires Around the World</h1><br>
    </div>
    <p>Most people, when talking about vampires, will have at least a basic understanding of what one is. Bloodsucker, kidney eater, witch, collection of 1000 bats in a trench coat, the list of cultural interpretations goes on (Angermueller). What most people will say, though, is that vampires are obviously just fiction. Made up, folk lore, not a real thing that exists in this world as it stands today. That couldn’t be father from the truth, though. Real life vampires exist, and they are members of society.</p>
    <p>Vampirism, that of a human turned into a monster that eats other people or their blood, or that of a born monster who does the same, is legendary (Angermueller). In that sense, real life people do not have any condition called ‘Vampirism’, but rather something else. Vampires, and the vampire community, splits itself into two separate types of people (AVA). Sanguine vampires, named after Sanguine red, itself hailing from the Latin “Sanguis”, meaning blood or bloody. And Empathetic or Empathic vampires, given that name because of the special condition of their vampirism.</p>
    <p>Sanguine vampires, called as such because of the fact that they drink or consume human blood, are what most people would consider closest to “real” vampires as you are able to get, without dipping into the super natural (AVA). Partially a population and community made up of people who don’t feel as if they can truly live without drinking blood, those who gain energy from it, and partly made up of people who just, really like the taste of blood, for a variety of reasons. What especially makes sanguine vampires outstanding members of society, is how they treat themselves and others.</p>
    <p>People mistake vampires for blood-fetishists (TheoFantastique). Now that’s not to say that they can’t be that, but by and large, they aren’t. Despite all of that, vampires and the kink community share a lot of common ground when it comes to consent and negotiation of behavior. Sanguine vampires are very contentious of how, from who, and where, they get their blood. Rules and mandates about always asking multiple times, only taking blood from people you know and are fine with it, and only taking blood in ways or methods that everyone has agreed upon and consented to. As a whole, the sanguine vampire community is a very upstanding example of how consent, in regard to kink, sex, or any other matter, should be held up as the highest standard of practice. And when it is found out that someone is not performing in this way, actions are swiftly taken.</p>

    <p>The other type of vampire, the one that even less people know about, is the empathic vampire, those who experience empathetic vampirism, sometimes known as a psychic vampire (AVA). This is a form of high-empathy, empathy that manifests itself in a psychosomatic experience, instead of just being a psychological experience of low-empathy. Empathetic vampirism manifests in such a way that the vampire does not feel much of anything until they are around another person, at such time in which they “suck up” the emotions of that other person, starting to feel as their ‘victim’ feels (Hesse). Sometimes, depending on the other person, this can cause them to ‘lose emotional feeling’. Given that this is, in some cases, not an entirely controllable phenomenon, there is sometimes a bit of an issue, given the rest of the vampire communities emphasis on consent.</p>

    <p>Vampire associations, or covens, or whatever the local official gathering of vampires is called, will typically have their own rules on what is or is not allowed from the members (AVA). Given the range of vampires that can join, though some specify that the association is for a certain type of vampire only, this can cause problems if you apply the required consent rule of sanguine vampires, to the sometimes involuntary emotional suckage inherent in emotional vampirism. Typically, these issues are resolved in house, or on a case by case basis, or solved by forming separate gatherings of emotional and sanguine vampires, though this does not help to close a community divide as such.</p>
    <p>Vampirism, and vampires in general, as legends and folk lore, are feared worldwide (cite me), and for justifiable reasoning (Angermueller). As such, it is often a criticized facet of the real-life vampire community, that they willingly chose to mark themselves with a word that brings up thoughts of killing and unwilling violation. Maybe they would not have faced, and continue to face, such discrimination and fear, if they had chosen a different name. Maybe it wouldn’t be debated if they exist at all, if they weren’t linked to something that is strewn in myth and fantasy</p>

    <p>The Atlanta Vampire Alliance is one of the oldest public vampire associations nationwide (AVA). The co-founder, Merticus, is very often the one called when someone needs to interview a vampire, or to discuss vampire culture in general. The official sponsor of the Vampirism & Energy Work Research Study, in coordination with other vampire houses and community leaders. Doing research in to vampires, vampirism, what’s going on and how to better help people who are involved. Accredited scientists even get behind vampires in this regard, even if it’s taking a long time to get study’s out (Wall).</p>
    <p>Open mindedness is the key to acceptance, in regards to anything. When you’re constantly worried about close-minded or headline chasing news media attributing the next murder to a vampire cult, life can get very frustrating, as Merticus himself said (Wall). While real life vampires may not be the next social justice struggle to fight and die with, this is a day and age where civil rights for all is something that is looking more and more achievable, and vampires worldwide hope that they are included in that. But even as such, the intracommunity relations are very good, and everyone helps everyone else out.</p>

    <p>In a society where you’re constantly hearing about violence, terrorism, hostility and everything else that is bad about this era, vampirism is a nice reprieve (Wall). Set ground rules, very accepting and inviting community, little to no outward hostility, nor inward hostility, and good advocacy. The vampire community is a good model of what good niche communities look like, in-spite of how the world at large sees them.</p>
    <p>Even though, on the scale that most communities are measured on, the current international vampire community is very new, being around for only around 30 years, it is the hope that they stick around for a long time. Still, they had been around before that, and they will continue to be around if this falls apart, as people. Vampires, as people, are not going to go away that easily, and they shouldn’t have to. They are just as real as everyone else, and deserve the acknowledgement of that just as much as anyone.</p>
