      <h2>Carrot Catcher</h2>
      <h4>By: Emerson "DecaRat"</h4>
    </div>
    <p>Little game written in Lua as a proof of concept, as well as being just "something to do", this is not the best game.</p>
    <p>What it <i>is</i> though, is a nice time sink that'll get you coming back every time you die. It'll engage you, it'll make you scream at your computer, grit your teath, generally all that stuff that makes you want to rage at the game, and then come back 5 minutes later.</p>
    <p>All with a concept as simple as catching carrots, and running from rats and bats that'll try to take them from you, while avoiding giant rhinos just meandering around a washed out green wasteland.</p>
    <p>You may ask yourself, "Why are the carrots raining from above?" or "Why do the rats and bats want them?" or "Why do <i>I</i> want them?", or even "WTF is the rhino about?!"</p>
    <p>There are no answers to these questions. There likely never will be. Play the game. It's free. There's no reason not to.</p>
    <p>Having said that, windows might be like "yo this is weird do you wanna run it?" If that does happen, just click 'more info' and then 'run anyway'. It's just windows firewall being pissy that it's not signed and all that. Promise there's no virus nor spyware here.</p>

    <h4>Change Log:</h4>
    <p>V1.0.1:</p>
    <ul class="changelog">
      <li>-Due to a problem where frames spontaneously drop, the player could go out of bounds, which then causes you to be unable to move. The out of bounds part was fixed, but the random FPS drops still happen. Not sure why.</li>
      <li>-Previously, the carrots would fall and be seen as underneath the rhino. This is no longer the case. The rhino does not float above the carrots.</li>
      <li>-The version was changed from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 after 1 day of release.</li>
      <li>-Sounds are now stored in memory rather than streamed. I thought this would fix the FPS drop at least a tiny bit, but it didn't.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>V1.0:</p>
    <ul class="changelog">
      <li>First official release. If you've seen any beta versions, good job! If you download any prior versions from this site, please Contact me.</li>
