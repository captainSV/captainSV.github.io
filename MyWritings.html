    <p>Peice I wrote for The Asexual's "Agender: Anthology" submission, this is all about, as the title suggests, living life as a Nonbinary or Agender person, when over all the world we live in is not at all supportive towards us.</p>
    <h2><a href="/LegendaryVampires.html">Vampires Around the World</a></h2>
    <p>Peice I wrote for a collage writing class, on vampire legends. Put up here for ease of citing in my other project on vampires.</p>
