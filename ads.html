    <h1> Sasha Valeria the Nonbinary Vampire. <!--They/Them or Fae/Faer pronouns, please :)--></h1>
    <p>This is a new Website, by Sasha Valeria. Nonbinary coder and writer, I do random stuff when I have time.</p>
    <p>I made Slorp bot on discord, they're really helpful.</p>
    <p>My discord handle is Капитан Саша Валериа#2002 if you want to DM me or something.</p>
    <p>I make about 0 dollars from doing work, at the moment. Mostly because I'm really focused on school, but also simply because doing writing commisisons is suprisingly hard. If you want to donate at <a href="https://www.ko-fi.com/SashaValeria"> my kofi</a> that would be awesome!</p>
    <p>In the same vain, my <i>coding</i> work is mostly supported (though not at all currently, that's where the plug comes in) by my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/SashaValeria">Patreon!</a> If you like me, what I do, or just feel generous, either method of monitary support would be greatly appriciated!</p>
    <h6>ATM this is it, but maybe come back later when I'm not depressed as fuck and this is more built up</h6>
