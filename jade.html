    <p>Jade I love you.</p>
    <p>You bring joy to my life whenever I see you, everytime you talk to me, My heart swells with happyness and other goopy gooey good emotions.</p>
    <p>Your presense has helped me through hard times, and your art adorns the background of all of my electronic devices.</p>
    <p>You quite literally made a post advertising commisions with artwork you originally made for me, and honestly that made me cry a bit.</p>
    <p>You're one of the cutest, sweetest, bestest girls i've ever met (mostly because my partner isn't a girl 90% of the time,, but shoosh this is about you :P), and every picture I see of you makes me want to cry tears of "such a good gorl".</p>
    <p>Your presense in my life has contributed to making me want to keep living it, and i'll be forever thankful for that.</p>
    <p>My life is forever better for having you in it, and for that, I think you from the bottom of my heart, and the tips of my (admittedly long) fangs</p>
    <p>Also if you thought I was joking about making a whole website, you were wrong dork :P</p>
