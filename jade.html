    <p>Jade is a wonderful person.</p>
    <p>She shows empathy and understanding for people, even those that are maybe not really deserving of it int he moment, because she sees people for what they are AND can be. Specifically i'm talking about how she interacts with frisk, especially when fae are not emotionally regulating properly and being kinda mean, to faerself and others, as a result. Jade doesn't get mad back, as some people do, nor does she attempt to placte, as some people do, instead she looks at the shit frisk is saying and goes "hey, you're being abitch as a coping mechanism, and i do'nt have to deal with that, but i hope you know i want you to get better about this". Like IDK if you know but that really hit different.</p>
    <p>You quite literally made me want to come back to FBG purely because i knew that it would really be the only place i could reliably talk with you, given we both profess to be kind of bad with rememebering to dm people except certain ones. Like, the amount of triggering content i willingly put up with to be able to talk with you is honestly something my therapist would either say i should stop engaging with, or praise me for being willing to attempt to get through it, idk i've not been able to go to one in years so i can't really go into detail about that. But I CAN go into detail about you, so.</p>
    <p>Your presense has helped me through hard times, talking with you always makes me feel better. Fun fact, the reason that i often blow up at people is specifically because i care deeply about them and our relationship, it's kind of a trauma responce. So like, it goes to show that yuo're a very care-about-able person, right? Like your contributions to the social setting work to make it a better place for everyone you care about, and i guess some you don't maybe idk about that though, and uh like i really enjoy when you get info-dumpy and explicatory about things that interest you like pmmm and de and uhhhhhhh yeah</p>
    <p>You're one of the cutest, sweetest, bestest girls i've ever met, right, that's evident, but also it takes exploring because like, when people typically say that there's an aspect of physical aesthetic to it, irght? But i have pretty bad aphantasia, i literally do not reemmber what you look like AT ALL, and i still find you extremely cute, because what i find cute about you is your personality, mannerisms, the way you talk, all of those things. Those are what make you cute, ,like, metaphysically. This was the point where i had to stop twice cuz i was blushing too much.</p>
    <p>And like, sapphia, i've talked to less maybe like a dozen times but se's also cool af, if that's not weird to say, uhhhhhhhh. Plurality, huh, haha &lt;_&gt; (still figuring that stuff out badufgpshdiufghpsdfg</p>
    <p>Your presense in my life has contributed to making me want to keep living it, and i'll be forever thankful for that.</p>
    <p>My life is forever better for having you in it, and for that, I think you from the bottom of my heart, and the tips of my (admittedly long) fangs</p>
    <p>Also if you thought I was joking about doing this you were totally wrong lol</p>
