      <h1>Vampires Around the World</h1><br>
    </div>
    <p>Humans fear that which is the unknown. The supernatural, the paranormal, that which they don’t understand, are all things to be feared and attacked. What is especially scary is that which looks like oneself, but is invariably different from a normal person in some way. Dead people come back from death to haunt or attack, or people that look like human but in some way seem like a different species. Vampires fall into the latter category, of a being that looks like any other human, but secretly actually eats people. Cultures and peoples around the world all have their own version of the vampire, from Bolivia to Transylvania to the Philippines.</p>
    <p>From the Tagalog Mandurugo to the Bolivian Abchanchu, vampire creatures, or at least those that are in some way vampiric by European standards, occur in most places around the world. (Bane)  Contrary to this, some places cut off from outside contact like Japan never developed true vampire legends. The standard legend, of which most would know from the likes of Dracula or Vlad Tepas III of Wallachia, is that of a being which drinks the blood of, or eats the flesh of, it’s human victim.</p>
    <p>espite the long and varied history of vampiric beings, the modern history of what is now considered a classical vampire occurred almost entirely in the eighteenth century, in the Romanian area of Transylvania and Wallachia (Va-la-hi-ah) (Naylor). The most well-known European vampire is Dracula, who’s mythos partly draws from the story, legends, and life of Vlad Tepas the Third, Voivode of Wallachia (Bane). The name Dracula comes from Vlad The Second, who took the name Vlad Dracul to show his allegiance to the Order of the Dragon. The stories came about centuries after Vlad the Impaler lived and died, but his brutal tactics of slaughter and legends of literal blood baths and drinking of blood fed into the surrounding Slavic folklore. </p>

    <p>One of the first recorded sightings of what is a typical vampire is in the Istria region of Croatia, a southern Slavic people and area (Peavy). Giure Grando was the vampire’s name. He had died in 1656, was buried, and then in 1672 the local towns reported him having risen from the grave, drinking people’s blood and killing them, as well as sexually harassing his widow, only being active during the night. The vampire was said to have been attacked by a priest with a wooden stake to the chest. When that failed to kill Guire, his coffin was dug up during the daylight, and beheaded with a saw. From just this single story you have nearly the entire common mythos of vampires, nearly a hundred years before it’s common prevalence.</p>
    <p>Even the less native, but still prevalent, Roma population had myths and stories about vampires (Fanny) Such as one about a vampire who owed a creditor money, ‘died’ before it was paid, and then came back from the grave for three years to thank the man who graciously paid his latent debt off. This particular take on a vampire has the vampire be “particularly fond of the liver” instead of straight up drinking their victims blood.</p>

    <p>Many point to eastern Europe as the origin of classical vampirism, both in story and in language (Naylor). Though it is said that modern Russian words for vampire are borrowed from French and German, it is further said that French and German themselves borrowed the word from the South Slavic Serbo-Croatian language. The actual word Vampire etymologically, comes from the Serbo-Croatian “Вампир” (Vampi-r).</p>
    <p>Peoples worldwide study mythology. Many more are told stories from parents and family members, oft in an attempt to scare one into lessons or morals. Along those same lines, pop culture often times takes that which is myth, and makes it something tantalizingly close to reality. Novels, movies, plays, and more are written about horrifying mythological or legendary figures, in both negative and positive lights. The concept of demonic beings or humans come back from the dead to wreak havoc upon the world is as old as time, but the legend of the vampire specifically is a bit younger than that. Vampiric beings are as old as time, but go back to anyone living in the 1600s outside of Croatia and speak of a “Vampire” and you’d be met with confused looks. It is often forgotten that, though the myths run deep, the modern words used to describe said myths, and their connotation, are just as modern as the language which is used to speak them.</p>
