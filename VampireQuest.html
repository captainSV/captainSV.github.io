      <h2>Vampire Quest: Ruby Blood Catcher</h2>
      <h4>By: Sasha Valeria, based upon the work done by Emerson "Em" Decarat</h4>
    </div>
    <p>Little game written in Ruby as a conversion of another game to now feature vampires! As said about the original, this is not the best game.</p>
    <p>What it <i>is</i> though, is a nice time sink that'll get you coming back every time you die. It'll engage you, it'll make you scream at your computer, grit your teath, generally all that stuff that makes you want to rage at the game, and then come back 5 minutes later.</p>
    <p>All with a concept as simple as drinking blood, and running from stakes and bats that'll try to drain it from you.</p>
    <p>Having said that, windows might be like "yo this is weird do you wanna run it?" If that does happen, just click 'more info' and then 'run anyway'. It's just windows firewall being pissy that it's not signed and all that. Promise there's no virus nor spyware here.</p>
